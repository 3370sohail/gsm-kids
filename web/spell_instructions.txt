This is a spelling game. You will be presented with a word. When you hover over this word,
 it will be repeated back to you. Underneath the word are two buttons. When you hover over
 the buttons, they will tell you their functions. The check letters button repeats every 
letter you have typed so far. The check spelling button tells you whether you have spelled 
the word correctly.
